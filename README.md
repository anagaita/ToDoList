## Tech used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

### Observations:
In this project I focused on using semantic HTML.
I am still improving my CSS skills, in this project I decided to use variables to define colors and fonts and I still need to better name them.
I tried using contrasting colors so it would be more acessible to read.
With the JavaScript i have a lot of eventListeners and the app can have delayed responses, mainly when clicking the create-task-btn and the new-note-btn, so thats the next thing I will try optimizing.
I had an hard time figuring how to create new tasks with unique IDs, I had to research the awnser because I couldn't figure it out by myself.

#### Things I Learned:
Practiced the createElement() and appendChild() methods;
Practiced adding eventListeners on the document;
Learned to create an unique ID with Math.random().toString().slice();
Practiced manipulating CSS properties with JavaScript mainly style.display.
